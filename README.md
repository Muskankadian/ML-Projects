# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my machine learning projects repository! This repository contains implementations of two fundamental machine learning projects: **Iris Flower Classification** and **Red Wine Quality Prediction**. These projects are designed to showcase various machine learning techniques and provide practical applications for data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Projects

### 1. Iris Flower Classification
- **Description**: This project involves classifying iris flowers into different species based on their physical attributes. The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on these features.
- **Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Features**:
  - Data exploration and preprocessing
  - Application of various classification algorithms (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
  - Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
  - Visualization of results and model performance

### 2. Red Wine Quality Prediction
- **Description**: This project focuses on predicting the quality of red wine based on various physicochemical properties such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, and residual sugar. The dataset used is the Red Wine Quality dataset, which contains information about red wine samples and their quality ratings. The objective is to develop a regression model to predict wine quality and understand the impact of different features on the quality score.
- **Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Features**:
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
  - Application of regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)
  - Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared
  - Visualization of feature importance and model performance
